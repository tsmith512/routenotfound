# See https://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory
# this allows WordPress to be installed at /wp/ and be outside of this repo.
# When Composer installs/updates a package, it deletes the project root to do
# a clean install, but that'd wipe out everything in /wp-content/ if we don't
# silo WordPress into its own directory.

# Personal notes for php-fpm and ProxyPassMatch (which is just a relic of the
# old DrupalVM I use as a build box at the moment), need to redeclare
# ProxyPassMatch in the vhost config:

# ADD LINE (so that /wp/wp doesn't get repeated when FPM and Rewrite clash)
# ProxyPassMatch ^/wp/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$ "fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/drupalvm/drupal"
# EDIT LINE (add "/wp" on proxy path so that paths without /wp/ get executed within the correct root for when Rewrite doesn't pick it up)
# ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$ "fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/drupalvm/drupal/wp"

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /

# In this docroot, if the file doesn't exist, send it along to /wp/
# (so: catch theme and plugin assets here)
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/wp/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /wp/$1

# And if there's a request for the home page (site root), send it
# straight to the WordPress index
RewriteRule ^(/)?$ wp/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
